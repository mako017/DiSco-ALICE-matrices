# DiSco-ALICE Matrices

This is an adapted version of the DESIGMA [(Becker et al., XXXX)](#blank) that was used for the DiSco-ALICE study [(Hofer et al., in preparation)](#blank). It consists of 12 figural matrices items that are presented in order of increasing difficulty. The web app was written in a way that it could be displayed optimally on the iPads used in the current study.
